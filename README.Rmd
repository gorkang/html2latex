# html2latex

Convert sjPlot::tab_model() html tables to tex and pdf.  

## Installation
html2latex is currently only available on Github. This is originally from this repository: https://github.com/gorkang/html2latex/ - until the pull request is accepted, this will remain available as a package only on this repository here. 

``` r
#devtools("tjebo/html2latex")
library("html2latex")
```
## Requirements
We use [Libreoffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) to convert `html` to `odt` and [Writer2latex](https://sourceforge.net/projects/writer2latex/files/writer2latex/) for the `odt` to `tex` step. You will also need a TeX compiler if you want to use the inegrated pdf compilation. 

`html2pdf()` function uses a *Writer2latex* script which is sourced from the src folder.   

## Example  
Create a sjPlot::tab_model() and save it as html.  
```{r}
library(html2latex)
library(lme4)
library(sjPlot)

# This is a terrible model
model = lmer(mpg ~ cyl * disp + (1|vs), mtcars)

# We save the sjPlot table to an .html file
sjPlot::tab_model(
  model,
  show.r2 = TRUE,
  show.icc = FALSE,
  show.re.var = FALSE,
  p.style = "scientific",
  emph.p = TRUE,
  file = "temp.html")

```

Using the `sjplot2pdf()` we can transform it to .tex.  We can also compile to pdf in one step. 
```
# Create tex and pdf
sjplot2pdf(filename = "temp.html", table_width = 13, silent = TRUE, style = TRUE, build_pdf = TRUE, clean = TRUE)
```

If we create a pdf using `pdflatex` the end result looks like this:
