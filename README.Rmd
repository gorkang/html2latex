Convert sjPlot::tab_model() html tables to tex and pdf.  

## Installation

html2latex is currently only available on Github.

``` r
# remotes::install_github("gorkang/html2latex")
library("html2latex")
```
## Requirements
We use [Libreoffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) to convert `html` to `odt` and [Writer2latex](https://sourceforge.net/projects/writer2latex/files/writer2latex/) for the `odt` to `tex` step. You will also need a TeX compiler if you want to use the inegrated pdf compilation. 

`html2pdf()` function uses a *Writer2latex* script which is sourced from the extdata folder.   

## Example  
Create a sjPlot::tab_model() and save it as html.  
```{r, include = FALSE}
library(html2latex)
library(lme4)
library(sjPlot)

# This is a terrible model
model = lmer(mpg ~ cyl * disp + (1|vs), mtcars)

# We save the sjPlot table to an .html file

sjPlot::tab_model(
  model,
  show.r2 = TRUE,
  show.icc = FALSE,
  show.re.var = FALSE,
  p.style = "scientific",
  emph.p = TRUE,
  file = "temp.html")

```
```
library(html2latex)
library(lme4)
library(sjPlot)

# This is a terrible model
model = lmer(mpg ~ cyl * disp + (1|vs), mtcars)

# We save the sjPlot table to an .html file

sjPlot::tab_model(
  model,
  show.r2 = TRUE,
  show.icc = FALSE,
  show.re.var = FALSE,
  p.style = "scientific",
  emph.p = TRUE,
  file = "temp.html")

```

Using the `html2pdf()` we can transform it to .tex.  We can also compile to pdf in one step. 
```{r}
# Create tex and pdf
# This readme was knitted on a Mac, therefore mac = TRUE
html2pdf(filename = "temp.html", table_width = 13, silent = TRUE, style = TRUE, build_pdf = TRUE, mac = TRUE, clean = TRUE)
```

If we create a pdf using `pdflatex` the end result looks like this:

## tex2Rmd 
tab_model() html tables in a Rmd document

You can include tab_model() table in a Rmarkdown pdf in three steps: 

### 1. YAML header
The YAML heather of the .Rmd document must include this:  

```
header-includes:
- \usepackage{array}
- \usepackage{longtable}
- \newcommand\textstyleStrongEmphasis[1]{\textbf{#1}}
- \makeatletter
- \newcommand\arraybslash{\let\\\@arraycr}
```

### 2. Extract the table bit from the tex file
The tex file created with html2pdf can be rendered as a pdf by opening the tex file in Rstudio and using the `Compile PDF` button. But if you want to use the table code (from `\begin{longtable}` to `\end{longtable}`), we need to extract it first.  
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create table.txt to be able to use it in Rmd documents
tex2Rmd("temp.tex")

# File with table code created in: table.txt
```

### 3. Use this code in the Rmd document. 
Finally, you need to insert the latex code below outside of a chunk in your Rmd file.  

```
\newcommand{\myinput}[1]{%
  \begingroup%
  \renewcommand\normalsize{\small}% Specify your font modification
  \input{#1}%
  \endgroup%
}
\begin{centering}
\myinput{table.txt}
\end{centering}
```

---  
To see the result, please check the example.pdf in the github repository (will not be installed alongside the package)

(You might need to then call pdflatex in a terminal separately, if compiling via RStudio fails)

## Manually input latex code

Alternativelly, you can manually insert the contents of table.txt in a chunk staring with ` ```{=latex}`
